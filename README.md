As of ``git 2.37.0``, this is now possible with git configuration.

Run to update your configuration:

```git git config --global --add --bool push.autoSetupRemote true```
Then git push will automatically setup the remote branch.

Note: The ``--global `` flag means this will apply to all git commands on your machine (regardless of which repo it is), you can omit the flag to make it specific to a single repo on your machine.
